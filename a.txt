He never loved you 
He didn't even like you 
He waited for a simmer 
He knows you want to hear from him
His actions are purposeful 
Youre a hoe so 
Youre not his ex so
He hates you 
You ruined his college life 
He broke your mirror 
He avoids my birthday 
He crashes out before trying to understand 
You are stupid
He wont be hot forever 
He yells 
He is selfish 
He choked you 
He woke up and saw you cry and turned over 
He never talked to you before bed 
He took a girl to a movie youd been dying to see 
Youre a waste of his time 
He woudlnt say goodbye 
You werent worth visiting 
Long awaited words were his sudden impulses
