He never loved you 
He didn't even like you 
He waited for a simmer 
He knows you want to hear from him
His actions are purposeful 
Youre a hoe so 
Youre not his ex so
He hates you 
You ruined his college life 
He broke your mirror 
He avoids your birthday 
He crashes out before trying to understand 
You are stupid
He wont be hot forever 
He yells 
He is selfish 
You wake in physical pain still
He woke up and saw you cry and turned over 
He never talked to you before bed 
He never cared to talk at all
You were never smart enough for him 
He doesnt find your qualities admirable
He took a girl to a movie youd been dying to see 
Youre a waste of his time 
He woudlnt say goodbye 
You werent worth visiting 
Long awaited words were just his sudden impulses 
He doesnt care to contact or see you 
He will never see you 
He hates you 
He only came to one game and flirted instead 
He sucks 
He enjoys time away from you 
You haven't heard from him because he doesnt gaf and is lazy and thinks he hasnt done anything at all 
Its my fault 
When you rewatch your videos youre laughing and he always ends up yelling 
He thinks youre ugly and not good enough for him 
He said he'd only date people who are truly exceptional 
He doesn't even love you 1%
