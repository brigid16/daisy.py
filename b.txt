I miss him 
He could love me
I gave him such poor responses 
He cupped my skull so soothingly
He brought me a smoothie 
I want him to text me 
No respect for myself
Hes so hot 
I could love him 
But hes so cool and he talks like the whole worlds listening and i roll my eyes affectionately 
Ive cried 
His hands are so beautiful 
I hate regretting 
I hate hating 
Its so sad I cant accept it 
Will he see me 

I used to say I would marry him
Our emails and our texts 
I would kiss him when the plane lands
this program has hurt my feelings 

Im dying this sucks
It feels worse now than im back in ic 
How can he not care 
how is he not dying 
bro
why do i care 
i hate it
I like our pictures 
i stared at my paper copy at night and when i woke up 
his laugh makes me cry 
fuck you program 
i hate both of you 
security feels different than i thought
Seeing him soon means never seeing him again 
I have to be okay with that
