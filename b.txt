I miss him 
He could love me
I gave him such poor responses 
He cupped my skull so soothingly
He brought me a smoothie 
I want him to text me 
No respect for myself
Hes so hot 
I could love him 
But hes so cool and he talks like the whole worlds listening and i roll my eyes affectionately 
Ive cried 
His hands are so beautiful 
I hate regretting 
I hate hating 
Its so sad I cant accept it 
Will he see me 



I used to say I would marry him
Our emails and our texts 
I would kiss him when the plane lands
this program has hurt my feelings
